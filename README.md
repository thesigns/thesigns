- 👋 Hi, my name is Jakub Adamczyk.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but I want to become a professional programmer. 
- 📜 I started programming as a teenager but it was just a casual hobby. I used to work as a graphic designer.
- 🌱 Currently I’m learning everything about frontend. I want to create my own pinhole camera and ketchup with ginger.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well... I'm not sure. We will see.
- 📫 If you want to reach me, this is my e-mail: **jwf.adamczyk (the at sign) gmail.com** and my website: **https://thesigns.icu/**
- 🍐 The Universe is just a fruit bearing it's own fruits. That's my position on Universe. Yep, we live in a big fruit.
- ❤️ Fruits can have feelings too. Don't be too hard on yourself, the Universe or the others.
