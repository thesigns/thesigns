- 👋 Hi, my name is Jakub Adamczyk.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, but right now I'm on a path to become a professional programmer.
- 📜 I started programming as a teenager but it was just a casual hobby. I used to work as a graphic designer.
- 💻 Currently I’m learning as much as I can about frontend development.
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking for a job as a junior frontend developer. I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 📫 If you want to contact me, please use the e-mail: jwf.adamczyk@gmail.com
